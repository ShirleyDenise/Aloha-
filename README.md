Project 1 / Part 1 - Aloha Homepage


Summary:

For this project I had to build a homepage for a clothing brand. This was my first attempt at creating a homepage.

Technologies used:

In this part 1 of the project I used HTLM to build the structure of the homepage and then used CSS for the design. 


What  I have learnt:

Once the HTML code was ready, I spent 90% of my time working/ fighting /playing with CSS. 
This was a great way of learning how to use CSS to style this homepage. 
I have learnt many things, such as making sure that the HTML code is well organised to be able to use CSS properly, such as elements, classes or Ids.
To use internet when stuck on a problem and try to adapt the solution for this project.
Changing one thing can affect other elements already set and sometime you have to rethink what you did previously.
I mostly learnt that coding is a work in progress and that you learn by testing your code.
